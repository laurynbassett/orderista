# Orderista

_Restaurant Map Finder_

Orderista was built over 3 days during my review week at Fullstack Academy. This website was built to help find and get info on nearby restaurants.

## Tech Stack

I used React, Redux, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL as the basis for Orderista. For data API, I used Zomato API. For mapping the restaurants, I used Mapbox GL JS. I also used the Material-UI component library as the basis for my React components.
